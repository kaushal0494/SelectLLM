If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?\n",
    "Let's think step by step\n",
    "Angelo and Melanie think they should dedicate 3 hours to each of the 2 chapters, 3 hours x 2 chapters = 6 hours total.\n",
    "For the worksheets they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet, 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = 6 hours total.\n",
    "Angelo and Melanie need to start with planning 12 hours to study, at 4 hours a day, 12 / 4 = 3 days.\n",
    "However, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. Every hour they want to include a 10-minute break, so 12 total hours x 10 minutes = 120 extra minutes for breaks.\n",
    "They also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks, 3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes.\n",
    "And they want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day, so 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = 180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = 3 extra hours.\n",
    "So Angelo and Melanie want to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = 15 hours total.\n",
